          Hello! My name is Chris. I enjoy programming and problem solving and I like the idea of creating amazing work that people use everyday. In addition to my education, I have worked in the computing field for many years. I have spent the last several years supporting various systems for a major media company as well as for prominent book, magazine and journal publishers. My responsibilities have included database development as well as general desktop and server support. As a recent graduate of the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp, I am now pursuing a position that combines my database development experience and my knowledge of web technologies.
